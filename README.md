# Machine-Learning-Distributed-Nusselt-Numbers-Efficient
Example of neural network to predict the local Nusselt number distributions in turbulent flows past rough surfaces.

The code include all the software to:
- Pre-process the rough surface data.
- Train the convolutional neural network.
- Post-process the results.
- Create an automated PowerPoint presentation with the details for each case.
