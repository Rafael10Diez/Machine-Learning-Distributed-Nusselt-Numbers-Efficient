NOTE:
- The Nusselt numbers are computed with a length scale of $\delta = L_y/2$.
- This was done due to the pre-processing considering only half the DNS domain for the top and bottom parts.
- The conversion to the Nusselt number with the full channel size can be obtained by multiplying by two:
   - $Nu(L_y) = 2 \ Nu(\delta)$
   - The conversion is always linear, since it is only a convention.
